# CSC225_Summer2018

These projects were built over the summer of 2018 for an Intro to Web Development and the Internet course.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

### `firstWebpage.html`
This is the first website that I designed in the course, which uses headers, inline styling, unordered lists, and alignment.

### `index.html`
This is the first homepage that I built and continued to add upon during the course. It includes links to all of my other projects as well as an _About Me_ section.
- uses `homepage.css` for the CSS styling

### `flooring.html`
This website allows for the user to order flooring for any sort of room. It takes in the dimensions of the room, and based off of set prices for the size and type of tile, it will calculate the total amount for the order.
- uses `flooring.js` as the JavaScript file to print out the customer's "receipt".

### `Tables.html`
This website allowed me to use tables to organize text, images, and links into neat rows and columns. 

### `bootstrapmainpage.html`
This is the most updated homepage that I built which incorporated bootstrap into my original homepage to make it more responsive but also to add more flair to the original homepage.
- uses `homepage2.css` for the CSS styling

### `flooring2.html`
Similar to `bootstrapmainpage.html`, I updated `flooring.html` to include bootstrap and to revamp the look of the original website.
- uses `flooring2.js` as the JavaScript file to print out the customer's "receipt".

### `WebsiteSpoof.html`
This website is a spoof of [ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com). This project was to change around some of the links, text, and/or images of the website to make it funnier and more playful.
